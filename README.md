# ⌨️ TwoHalvesOneCode  

*A repo where I solve coding challenges (Codewars/LeetCode/etc.) while forcing myself to use my [Cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino) split keyboard that I built myself.*

*Two goals:*  
1. **Code better** (logic, Python (and maybe other languages too like Javascript and Go), Vim bindings).  
2. **Type better** (muscle memory on this self-built keeb).

## 🛠️ My ~~Uncomfortable~~ Setup  
### **Laptop Setup**  
- **Position**: On the edge of my bed, laptop on a chair, keyboard *on top* of the laptop, cursed but kinda comfy lul.  
- **Tools**:  
  - Browser: Brave.  
  - Editor: Neovim + custom LazyVim config.    

### **PC Setup**  
- **Position**: Actual desk with some space + chair .  
- **Tools**:  
  - Browser: Brave.
  - SSH from Windows Terminal → Linux Mint laptop.  
  - Tmux for copy-paste sorcery.

## 📂 File Structure  
/challenges/ # Solutions grouped by platform (Codewars/LeetCode) and inside them grouped by date.

/daily_logs/ # Ramblings about progress, keyboard struggles, etc. Basically what I want to talk about on that session.

---

## 🤔 Why This Exists  
- **For me**: Track progress + guilt-trip myself into consistency.  
- **For you**: I don't know actually XD.
