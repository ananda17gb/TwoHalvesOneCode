Thank god codewars algorithm didn't gave me anything hard, they are incredibly easy. Today I'm working on my blog website project and just setting up the infrastructure is already giving me somewhat a headache but at least I know where I'm going with it now I'll try to implement it tomorrow. The reason for the headache is like I want to use my home server (it's just a used laptop, the laptop that I used back in high school) and it is somewhat not the best practice I think because most people would just use the cloud service of the services they want to use but here me sitting with my podman and docker container XD, but at least I can use my used laptop as something more useful XD, its touchpad doesn't even work but ssh is the way to do homelabbing XD.

As for the problems and AI solutions I don't think there's too much to talk other than it provides best practice by implementing types safety stuff.
