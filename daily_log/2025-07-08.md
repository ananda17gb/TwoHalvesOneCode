Hello there manage to maintain my streak today, did three problems as usual. I tried to do rankup but damn after seeing the first problems, it's a 4kyu, I tried it a bit and then just gave up and also for some of the fundamentals problems too XD maybe I just don't really want to think heavy today after what happen earlier today, you don't need to know but it's all fine though if we keep that in mind in the end would be like that and if not just flip you know XD.

As for the AI the problems I finally implement dictionary which I think is somewhat useful for solving this problems and it was surprisingly easy XD. And then how it is possible to make tuple "immutable" by using type changing, or something like that.

As for the AI solutions idk just good I guess XD.
