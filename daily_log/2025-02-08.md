I manage to keep the streak going this time not only that I am finally working on my projects too after I get bored with the game I play. As for today's session I finally tinker with my keeb and it is kinda better I think what I did were just two things moving the mouse layer's mouse click to be the same as how real mouse is right click on the right on so for the left. The second one is the tap and hold feature where I reduce the tapping term from 250 to 150 and it works I think better though I need few more session too see if this setup is better.

As per usual I solve three problems on codewars and they are pretty easy but it makes me remember about triangle, especially the rule for a triangle to be drawn. Other than that, there's nothing that is special about the problems.

As for the AI solution, I think I did a pretty good job on writing the code and how I solve the problem and it just gave me like some or one alternative(s). Like for example is_integer(), max(), etc.
