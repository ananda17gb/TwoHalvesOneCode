Hello again, as I said yesterday about using my keyboard more on my project I did that today and I think I'm about to finish one today, it's my portfolio website. The reason why I redo it (I already make two before this) is because I want to try Nextjs and I want to change the content of the website following what I said yesterday about that video, yeah basically that.

As for the problems they are not that hard, I guess, as long as there's no time limit XD.

As for the AI solutions I think it implement one-line for loop more which I would say is pretty useful so I need to learn it.
