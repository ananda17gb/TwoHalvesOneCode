Hello again there, there's not too much going on for today nothing changed about my keyboard and I'm enjoying this setup on my pc which I added a second monitor, using a used monitor that we had from like my childhood and is perfect for the pc setup. I actually rocking this setup since like day three I think but yeah.

As for the solution they are not that hard I guess, at least logically I just need to know the syntax needed to solve the problem like ord to know the ascii of a character.

As for the AI solutions I'm reminded to again think more before solving, I mean in a way I know how to solve it but it maybe not the best one but I don't mean that I need to always give the best solution most of the time, I think if the solution works and fit to the criteria then it's good, right? Other than that it gave me some alternative to my solutions such as using dictionary and one-line loop.

Oh yeah I'm recently feeling to write these daily logs XD, I don't know if it is apparent through my writings, like on my yesterday's log I forgot to put the footnote and just add it now XD, but that's what I feel and I don't think stopping writing this is good but I guess I'll just keep writing this as best as I can.
