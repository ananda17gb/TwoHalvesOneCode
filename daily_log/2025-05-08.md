Ok hello again today, the seventh day of this project, and as for yesterday's problem with the backspace key I fixed it yesterday right after I finish the session just a few solder and blows and it is fixed and is much much better than before.

As for the problem today's session I was given 5kyu problem but it is easier than yesterday's 6kyu.

As for the AI solution I think it is good to know it said that my code works but can it be improve but I don't even know how its code doing XD especially on the 5kyu where it uses %26 like how can someone know about that XD but I guess we live in a big world so there is someone who think differently XD, other than that it suggest a one-liner and yeah I guess that's all.

As for setup I do the same as yesterday.
