Doing this in the "morning" again just to keep me motivated to do coding later I guess better start with this session than procrastinating to do my projects XD.

As for the problems I skipped some problems XD some are even 7 8kyus but it needed me to think more so I skipped them XD. As for AI solutions, it said that I need to try to use enumarate instead of declaring a variable that increments.
