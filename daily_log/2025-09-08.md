Hello there its pretty sunny outside XD, I usually do session in the evening but I don't know I feel like I want to do it now, get up from bed and some minutes after that do this session XD. Oh yeah and I also did six problems today because I'm afraid I'll not be able to do it tomorrow but if there's time than maybe I'll try solving three problems as usual.

As for the problems I don't think they are really hard, idk but I feel like most of the time the problem is on the syntax itself rather than just the problem, although for me they are marginal so XD. Like if you look at my code and the AI solution it is very different like the AI can just do far better than me XD not to be pessimistic but idk XD.
