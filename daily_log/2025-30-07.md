To improve my coding skill (in both logic, language, and vim bindings) and to use my keyboard, [Cheapino](https://github.com/tompi/cheapino), that I built by myself I decided to start this journey. As for the plan I don't really know other than just to do it consistently until I'm good at "wielding" this keyboard, I guess, don't know when will that be but I should just start and keep going. So, until then I'll just be using this setup only for this purpose not on my actual projects, maybe.

Just done doing [these](../challenges/codewars/2025-30-07/), even though they're somewhat easy the true challenge is to actually type them in CodeWars' vim mode XD. It's kinda hard to know the timing of the tap-hold of this keyboard and I would definitely need to fix this for the future.

Also as you can see at the AI solution based on my code it said that it is pretty good but can be better by:

1. Instead of manual checking I can just use Python's built in tools, such isdigit (to know if a variable is a digit or not), abs (for absolute), and more
2. Use ternary operatin to achieve single line.
3. Implement more other stuff such as try and catch, lambda, dictionary
