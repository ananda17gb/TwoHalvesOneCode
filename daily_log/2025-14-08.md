Keeping the streak up for this session and coding project. As for the session they are not too too hard especially the 6kyu as for the project I think I'm somewhat finish with the backend and can move on to testing it and then implementing it but still though I'm not that good with writing the code myself so it is still basic, at least if I compare it with what AI gave me on my other backend projects, like it seems that mine is more focus on common cases and not edge but at least I write the code myself with the help of googling, documentation, and stackoverflow not too much AI and I think that's far better than what the AI would give me for my benefit in the future.
