Unfortunately I didn't do yesterday's session but I'll make it up for it today so I'll be doing twice the amount, so six problems.

Ok just finished six problems and from them I got some interesting challenge where I need to do sorting, which has been sometimes since I last seen it, and other stuff that is harder than yesterday's but its all good though. I also learn to actually read not just jump into the problems like that xs and os problem where the solution is far far simpler than what I did XD but I guess I learned and remembered some things from today's session.

As for typing I think I am better at using this keyboard but I still haven't tinkered it though so the problem that I came across on day one still persist but because today's session I use my pc to ssh to my laptop the setup is much better than what I got on my laptop setup, here I have a proper table and chair which makes typing on this keyboard much better.

Also from the AI solution I learned a few (new) things such as:

1. enumerate for looping
2. lower and upper for capitalization
3. sorted, set, union, and join
4. split
5. dictionary and format (f)
