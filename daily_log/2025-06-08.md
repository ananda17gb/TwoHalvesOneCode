Decided to do Leetcode this time after seeing Web Dev Simplified uploaded a video of him doing the Top Interview 150 and I did the tagged easy ones and they are kinda easy if we just want to solve it but if we want to look further into optimization, big Os and stuff it would be a lot harder at least for me because even just to finish 27 it takes some times because the problems is kinda different because there is this check that checks the original array and those stuff.

As for the AI solution it is giving me the "further" answer and it even made 27 looks far easier by just checking if val is still in the array XD and here me sitting looking at array out of bounds from some of the path that I chose. But I at least I'm solving problems I guess but I don't know if I'll learn from all of this though, just keep that in mind in the future if my code is still sucks XD.
