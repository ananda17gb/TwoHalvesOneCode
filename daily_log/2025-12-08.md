Continuing the streak this time decided to do +1 problems because I almost reached 400 score before that 6kyu problem and now I have reached 406. I don't know what to write here anymore XD. I mean there's nothing much happening other than I kinda want to make my own Neovim configuration that is more minimal because currently I'm using Lazyvim with added plugins for my needs, and I want to do more project XD especially my final year project and some of my project that I need to redo. And by doing that I want to improve my skills in web develoment and probably mobile but idk what project I should make for mobile, unless it is a cross platform I kinda have some idea in mind but I haven't really thinking about it I just type it down on a todo-project list but yeah I guess I should just start coding and let the wall of insecureness and stress hit me I guess.

As for the code I think they are prett easy even the 6kyu that is because I skipped the harder ones XD but I guess that's fine, no XD? As for the AI solution and know that I installed pyright on my neovim setup I can see more "warnings" like what I mentioned [here](../challenges/codewars/2025-12-08/ai_solutions/fundamentals_8kyu_correct_the_mistakes_of_the_character_recognition_software.py). That is good I guess especially if that code is used on a proper codebase and project to make coding easier even though for me things like this and clean code is most of the time kinda intimidating XD like everything is not in place even though it is an industry standard. And from the AI solution I think I need to use more enumerate to make the code cleaner even though not as beginner friendly.
