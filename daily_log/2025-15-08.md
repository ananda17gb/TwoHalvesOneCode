Keeping the streak up again, first coding session of the day (decided to do this session first because I'm not too motivated to do my project but hopefully after this I'm motivated).

As for the problems its not that hard is just that I don't know the syntaxes or I don't know how to do things but I do have the idea in mind like for sorting array without the need to do sorting manually.
